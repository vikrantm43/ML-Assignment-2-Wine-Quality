ML Assignment 2 - Wine Quality Binary Classification
Wine Quality Binary Classification with 6 ML Models &amp; Streamlit App
problem statement, dataset description (UCI Wine Quality, 1599 instances, 11 features + binary target), comparison table (use your printed metrics, e.g., XGBoost leads with Acc 0.80, MCC 0.59), and per-model observations (e.g., "Random Forest excels due to ensemble bagging, handling non-linearity better than Logistic Regression")


a. Problem Statement
Predict whether red wine is Good (quality ≥ 6) or Bad (quality < 6) using 11 physicochemical features. Binary classification task on UCI Wine Quality dataset. Implement 6 ML models, calculate 6 metrics, deploy interactive Streamlit app.

b. Dataset Description
Source: UCI ML Repository (winequality-red.csv)

Instances: 1,599 red wine samples

Features: 11 numeric (fixed_acidity, volatile_acidity, citric_acid, residual_sugar, chlorides, free_sulfur_dioxide
